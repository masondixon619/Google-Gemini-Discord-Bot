# Google-Gemini-Discord-Bot
This is simple base code written in python for a Discord bot that outputs Gemini responses to user inputs on command. You are required to create your own discord bot and obtain its token, as well as a Google Gemini api key. Any other Gen AI api key will not work.

## Discord Bot Creation
To create a discord bot, navigate to https://discord.com/developers.
If you have any issues, I recommend this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHbN_gB30Tw.

## Gemini API Key Creation
Navitage to https://aistudio.google.com/apikey. 
From there, key creation is simple. There are various plans allowing various amounts of tokens. I personally just used the free plan.
